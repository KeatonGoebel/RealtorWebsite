            <p id = "About me"> 
                Born in Jackson, KY, Tracey spent her childhood in the Appalachian Mountains. 
                After high school Tracey moved to Lexington and got a degree in pharmacy at the University of Kentucky.
                At UK she met her husband of 27 years, Nevin.
                After spending some time in Lexington they decided to move to his hometown of Winchester, where they had their two children.
                Together they owned Clark County Pharmacy for 17 years. 
                After selling their small buisness Tracey decided she needed a change.
                She wanted to combine the love of her small town with her enjoyment of helping people.
                Tracey has been working in real estate since 2021. 
                When Tracey is not selling homes she is playing with her dogs or tracking down her long lost relatives.
